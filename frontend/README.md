# Frontend Dashboard

To get started with the frontend development:

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Open in Browser**:
    http://localhost:3000

## Key Components

- `app/`: Next.js App Router structure
- `components/`: React components
- `lib/`: Utility functions and API clients
- `types/`: TypeScript definitions

## API Integration

The frontend connects to the backend API at `http://localhost:8000`. Ensure the backend (or mock server) is running.
